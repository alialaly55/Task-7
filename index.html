    <div class="div">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <span> readable content of a page when looking at its layout</span>. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
